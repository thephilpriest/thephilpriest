- 👋 Hi, I’m @thephilpriest
- 👀 I’m interested in data - bases, science, representations, abstractions and relationships.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning - how to have a GitHub project in the real world.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Magritte, my new project examining the movement of arbitrary objects in virutal pipes.
- 📫 How to reach me - Tie message to brick; lob brick on my direction; wait for reply.
- 😄 Pronouns: Yo, Dude, Essé, He, Himand His.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like the rain.

- This page is WIP. When I figure out what to really say, I'll fill this in better. Please be patient.
